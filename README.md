## About
This repository is the work of the 2019 3D Modelling team.
We are developing the simulation and testing environment for the University of Adelaide Summer Research Internship.
For more detailed information, please see each model domain in the 
### Wiki: https://github.com/UofA-EEE-LAUS/3D-modelling/wiki

## Installation 
### Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP)
This project uses V-REP release 3.6.2.
An open source robotics prototyping and simulation software package.
However as of 26/11/2019, V-REP has been superseeded by CopelliaSim.
V-REP is still downloadable at the time of writing.
All .ttt files should be forwards compatible with CopelliaSim.
Available for free at http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/

### MATLAB
For the RemoteAPI to V-REP, this project has chosen MATLAB. 
The project is currently using release 2019a, however 2019b should be used soon.
