## About
This repository is the work of the 2019 3D Modelling team.
We are developing the simulation and testing environment for the University of Adelaide Summer Research Internship.
<br> 
For more detailed information, please see each model domain in the wiki: https://github.com/UofA-EEE-LAUS/3D-modelling/wiki

## Installation 
### Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP)
This project uses V-REP release 3.6.2, an open source robotics prototyping and simulation software package.
<br>
As of 26/11/2019, V-REP has been superseeded by CopelliaSim.
V-REP is still downloadable at the time of writing and all .ttt files should be forwards compatible with CopelliaSim.
<br> Available for free at http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/

### MATLAB
For the RemoteAPI to V-REP, this project has chosen MATLAB. 
The project is currently using release 2019a, however 2019b should be used soon.
