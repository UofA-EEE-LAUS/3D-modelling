# Installation 
## Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP)
This project uses V-REP release 3.6.2.
An open source robotics prototyping and simulation software package.
However as of 26/11/2019, V-REP has been superseeded by CopelliaSim.
V-REP is still downloadable at the time of writing.
All .ttt files should be forwards compatible with CopelliaSim.
Available for free at http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/

## MATLAB
For the RemoteAPI to V-REP, this project has chosen MATLAB. 
The project is currently using release 2019a, however 2019b should be used soon.
